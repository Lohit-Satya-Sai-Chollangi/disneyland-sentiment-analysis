# 🎢 Disneyland Chronicles: Insights from Guest Reviews

A comprehensive sentiment analysis project leveraging text mining to uncover actionable insights from 42,000 guest reviews across Disneyland Paris, California, and Hong Kong.

## 📂 Dataset
📎 [Disneyland Reviews Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arushchillar/disneyland-reviews)

The dataset includes:
- Review text
- Rating (1 to 5)
- Reviewer location
- Disneyland branch (Paris, California, Hong Kong)
- Date of review

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze guest sentiments from reviews
- Classify feedback into positive and negative sentiments
- Identify key improvement areas and beloved experiences
- Recommend actions to enhance guest satisfaction

## 🧠 Project Highlights
- Preprocessed 42,000+ reviews from TripAdvisor (2010–2019)
- Performed text mining using **JMP** with stop lists, SVD, term weighting, and clustering
- Built and evaluated models using:
  - Regression
  - Neural Network
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Decision Tree
- Achieved **90.3% accuracy** for Disneyland California using **Binary + IDF weighting**
- Generated ROC curves to validate model performance across train/validation/test splits

## 💡 Key Business Insights
- **Pain Points Identified**: Expensive food, long queues, and wait times
- **Positive Feedback Areas**: Fireworks, parades, character interactions, specific rides like Grizzly Gulch
- **Branch Insights**:
  - California: 85% positive sentiment
  - Hong Kong: 80% positive sentiment
  - Paris: 71% positive sentiment

## 📌 Recommendations
- Implement **dynamic pricing** and more **value meal options**
- Use **virtual queue systems** and **app-based ride scheduling**
- Invest in **highly-rated attractions**
- Promote positive guest experiences in **region-specific marketing**
- Use **real-time analytics** for continuous experience optimization
- Enhance **employee training** on service quality and empathy
